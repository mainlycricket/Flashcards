# Flashcards
 This is a Flashcard Project, which I completed from JetBrains Academy.  It is a quiz which asks the capital names of serveral countries.  The user may guess it, and can hover the mouse over cards to know the correct answer.  The content can be edited to create other such card-based quizes.
